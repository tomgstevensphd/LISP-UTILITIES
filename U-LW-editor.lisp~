6.3 PROGRAMMING THE EDITOR   xxx
The editor functions described in this section can be combined and provided with arguments to CREATE NEW COMMANDS.

Existing editor commands can also be used in the creation of new commands.

xxx EVERY EDITOR COMMAND documented in this manual is NAMED BY A STRING COMMAND which CAN BE USED TO INVOKE THE COMMAND INTERACTIVELY, 
but there is also associated with this 
A STANDARD LISP FUNCTION (the "command function")
 named by a SYMBOL EXPORTED FROM THE EDITOR PACKAGE. 
You can use this symbol to call the command programmatically. 
For example, the editor command "FORWARD CHARACTER"
              is referred to by EDITOR:FORWARD-CHARACTER-COMMAND.

The FIRST ARGUMENT OF ANY COMMAND FUNCTION IS THE PREFIX ARGUMENT P,
 and this must therefore be included in any programmatic call, even if the prefix argument is ignored. Some commands have additional optional arguments. For
example to insert 42 #\! characters, you would call
(editor:self-insert-command 42 #\!)
Details of these optional arguments are provided in the command descriptions
throughout this manual.
See editor:defcommand for the details of how to create new commands.
Note: code which modifies the contents of a capi:editor-pane (for example a
displayed editor buffer) must be run only in the interface process of that pane.
The following sections describe editor functions that are not interactive editor
commands.

6.3.1 CALLING EDITOR FUNCTIONS  xxx
All editor commands and some other editor functions expect to be called within
a dynamic context that includes settings for the current buffer and current window. This happens automatically when using the editor interactively.

You can set up the context IN A CAPI APPLICATION by using the function
CAPI:CALL-EDITOR (see the CAPI User Guide and Reference Manual).

You can also use the following function TO CALL EDITOR COMMANDS AND FUNCTIONS.

EDITOR:PROCESS-CHARACTER FUNCTION  xxx

EDITOR:PROCESS-CHARACTER CHAR WINDOW
Processes char in a dynamic context where the current window is windowand the current buffer is the buffer currently displayed in window.6 Advanced Features
214
The CHAR can be one of the following:
• A STRING, NAMING AN EDITOR COMMAND to invoke.
• A LIST OF THE FORM (FUNCTION . ARGS), which causes function to be called with args. The ITEMS IN ARGS ARE NOT EVALUATED.

• A FUNCTION OR SYMBOL, which is CALLED WITH NIL AS ITS ARGUMENT (LIKE A
COMMAND FUNCTION WOULD BE IF THERE IS NO PREFIX ARGUMENT).

• A CHARACTER OR SYSTEM:GESTURE-SPEC OBJECT, which is treated as if it has been TYPED ON THE KEYBOARD.

THERE IS NO RETURN VALUE. The processing may happen in another thread, so may not have competed before this function returns.

6.3.2 DEFINING COMMANDS xxx

EDITOR:DEFCOMMAND MACRO

DEFCOMMAND NAME LAMBDA-LIST COMMAND-DOC FUNCTION-DOC &BODY FORMS => command-function
Defines a new editor command. name is a usually string naming the new
editor command which can invoked in the editor via Extended Command,
and command-function is a symbol naming the new command function
which can be called programmatically. The command-function symbol is
interned in the current package.
lambda-list is the lambda list of the new command, which must have at
least one argument which is usually denoted p, the prefix argument.
command-doc and function-doc should be strings giving detailed and brief
descriptions of the new command respectively.
forms is the Lisp code for the command.
The name of the command must be a string, while the name of the associated command function must be a symbol. There are two ways in which
name can be supplied. Most simply, name is given as a string, and the string
is taken to be the name of the editor command. The symbol naming the
command function is computed from that string: spaces are replaced with
hyphens and alphabetic characters are uppercased, but otherwise the sym6.3 Programmin

6.3.3.2 BUFFER OPERATIONS
editor:*buffer-list* Variable
Contains a list of all the buffers in the editor.

editor:current-buffer Function
editor:current-buffer
Returns the current buffer.
editor:buffer-name Function
editor:buffer-name buffer
Returns the name of buffer.
editor:window-buffer Function
editor:window-buffer window
Returns the buffer currently associated with window.
editor:buffers-start Function
editor:buffers-start buffer
Returns the starting point of buffer.
editor:buffers-end Function
editor:buffers-end buffer6.3 Programming the editor
221
Returns the end point of buffer.
editor:buffer-pointeditor:buffer-point buffer
Returns the current point in buffer.
editor:use-buffer Macro
editor:use-buffer buffer &body forms
Makes buffer the current buffer during the evaluation of forms.
editor:buffer-from-name Function
editor:buffer-from-name name
Returns the buffer called name (which should be a string). If there is no
buffer with that name, nil is returned.
editor:make-buffer Function
make-buffer name &key modes contents temporary base-name name-pattern
Creates or returns an existing buffer.
name should be a string or nil.
modes should be a list of strings naming modes. The first mode must be a
major mode, and the rest minor modes. The default value of modes is the
value of default-modes.
base-name should be a string or nil. If name and temporary are both nil
then ba

editor:make-buffer Function
make-buffer name &key modes contents temporary base-name name-pattern
Creates or returns an existing buffer.
name should be a string or nil.
modes should be a list of strings naming modes. The first mode must be a
major mode, and the rest minor modes. The default value of modes is the
value of default-modes.
base-name should be a string or nil. If name and temporary are both nil
then base-name must be a string.
contents should be a string, nil or t (default value nil).
temporary is a boolean (default value nil).
name-pattern should be a string (default value "~a<~a>").
When name is non-nil, it is the name of the buffer. If there is already a
buffer with this name which is not temporary and the temporary argument6 Advanced Features
222
is nil, make-buffer returns that buffer. Before doing so, it sets its contents
to contents unless contents is t. When contents is nil, the buffer is made
empty.
If name is nil or temporary is non-nil or a buffer with the name cannot be
found, then a new buffer is made and returned. The buffer's contents is set
to contents if contents is a string, and otherwise the buffer is made empty.
The name of the buffer is set to name if name is non-nil.

porary is a boolean (default value nil).
name-pattern should be a string (default value "~a<~a>").
When name is non-nil, it is the name of the buffer. If there is already a
buffer with this name which is not temporary and the temporary argument6 Advanced Features
222
is nil, make-buffer returns that buffer. Before doing so, it sets its contents
to contents unless contents is t. When contents is nil, the buffer is made
empty.
If name is nil or temporary is non-nil or a buffer with the name cannot be
found, then a new buffer is made and returned. The buffer's contents is set
to contents if contents is a string, and otherwise the buffer is made empty.
The name of the buffer is set to name if name is non-nil.
If temporary is nil, the buffer is added to the internal tables of the editor. If
name is non-nil, it is used. Otherwise make-buffer tries to use base-name. If
there is already a buffer with this name, it constructs another name by
(format nil name-pattern base-name n)
with different integers n until it constructs an unused name, which it uses
as the buffer’s name.
If temporary is non-nil, the buffer is not added to the internal tables. It is
also marked as temporary, which mainly means that it does not have autosave and backup files, and avoids calling general hooks when it is modified.
Notes:
Using :temporary t gives you a buffer that is 'yours', that is the editor
does not do anything with it except in response to explicit calls from your
code. Except when actually editing files, this is the most useful way of
using buffers in most cases.
capi:editor-pane with the :buffer :temp initarg uses
(make-buffer ... :temporary t)
editor:goto-buffer Function
editor:goto-buffer buffer in-same-window
Makes buffer the current buffer. If buffer is currently being shown in a window then the cursor is moved there. If buffer is not currently in a window
and in-same-window is non-nil then it is shown in the current window, otherwise a new window is created for it|#



#|Go Back Editor Command
Arguments: None
Key sequence: Ctrl+X C
Takes you back to the most recently recorded location. If a prefix argument
count is supplied, it takes you back count locations in the location history. If
count is negative, it takes you forward again count locations in the history,
provided that no more locations have been recorded since you last went
back.
Select Go Back Editor Command
Arguments: None
Key sequence: Ctrl+X M
Takes you back to a previously recorded location, which you select from a
list.
Any prefix argument is ignored.
Go Forward Editor Command
Arguments: None
Key sequence: Ctrl+X P
Takes you back to the next location in the ring of recorded locations. If a
prefix argument count is supplied, it takes you forward count locations in
the location history. If count is negative, it takes you back count locations in
the history

6.3.8 Files
editor:find-file-buffer Function
editor:find-file-buffer pathname &optional check-function
Returns a buffer associated with the file pathname, reading the file into a
new buffer if necessary. The second value returned is T if a new buffer is
created, and nil otherwise. If the file already exists in a buffer, its consistency is first checked by means of check-function. If no value is supplied for
check-function, editor:check-disk-version-consistent is used.
editor:fast-save-all-buffers Function
editor:fast-save-all-buffers &optional ask
Saves all modified buffers which are associated with a file. If ask is non-nil
then confirmation is asked for before saving each buffer. If ask is not set, all
buffers are saved without further prompting.
Unlike the editor command Save All Files this function can be run
without any window interaction. It is thus suitable for use in code which
does not intend to allow the user to leave any buffers unsaved, and from
the console if it is necessary to save buffers without re-entering the full
window system.
editor:check-disk-version-consistent Function
editor:check-disk-version-consistent pathname buffer
Checks that the date of the file pathname is not more recent than the last
time buffer was saved. If pathname is more recent, the user is prompted on
how to proceed. Returns t if there is no need to read the file from disk and
nil if it should be read from disk.
editor:buffer-pathname Function
editor:buffer-pathname buffer6.3 Programming the editor
231
Returns the pathname of the file associated with buffer. If no file is associated with buffer, nil is returned

6.4 EDITOR SOURCE CODE -- page 197 eduser-manual
The section does not apply to LispWorks Personal Edition.
LispWorks comes with source code for the editor, which you can refer to when
adding editor extensions.
6.4.1 Contents
The directory lib/6-1-0-0/src/editor/ contains most of the source files of the LispWorks editor. Some low-level source code is not distributed.
6.4.2 Source location
To enable location of editor definitions by Find Source and related commands, configure LispWorks as described under "Finding source code" in the LispWorks User Guide and Reference Manual.
6.4.3 Guidelines for use of the editor source code
Some care is needed when working with the supplied editor source code, to ensure that you do not compromise the IDE or introduce a dependancy on a particular release of LispWorks.
In particular please note:
• The editor source code may not match the compiled code in the Lisp-
Works image exactly, for example if editor patches have been loaded.
• Modifications to the EDITOR package definition are not allowed.
6 Advanced Features
198
• Redefining existing definitions is not recommended. It is better to define a new command to do what you want. If you find a bug or have a useful extension to an existing definition then please let us know.
• Do not rely on the expansion of exported macros.
• If you use any internal (that is, not exported) EDITOR symbols, please tell
us, so we can consider how to support your requirements. In addition,
some internal macros have been removed from the LispWorks image and
these should not be used.
